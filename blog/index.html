      COMPare - Changes to pre-specified outcomes must be declared and explained
      in the published trial report
    </title>
    <meta
      name="description"
      content='We thank the authors of the REEACT trial for their response to our letter.

The protocol they cite as “pre-specified” [1] is dated 10th December 2012, however data collection for the trial started in December 2009 - 3 years earlier [2]. We have therefore used the ISRCTN registry entry that predates the start of the trial to establish the pre-specified outcomes.

The authors state that in their ISRCTN registry entry the primary outcome is the PHQ-9 [3]. However, in the ISRCTN registry entry [4], the primary outcome is in fact: “depression severity and symptomatology as measured by a validated self-report measure (the Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) depression score at four months”. The only reference on Google to “International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) depression score" is the REEACT trial’s ISRCTN registry entry. We suspect the phrasing may refer to the WHO’s “Major Depression Inventory”, but believe this constitutes an imprecisely specified outcome. In any case it is clear from the registry entry that there is an additional outcome to the PHQ-9, that has not been reported or mentioned in the BMJ trial publication [2].

Item 6a of the CONSORT statement states that “all outcome measures, whether primary or secondary, should be identified and completely defined” and that details of how and when they were assessed should be reported in the trial publication [5]. Item 6b further states that “any changes to trial outcomes after the trial commenced, with reasons” should also be reported. Where pre-specified outcomes will be reported elsewhere, or non-prespecified outcomes have been added to the published report, this should be declared. Furthermore any changes to the pre-specified primary outcome, even if considered trivial, should be set out in the paper.

The authors go on to argue that the pre-specified secondary outcomes, “Health state utility (EuroQol [EQ5D]) at 4, 12 and 24 months” are not required to be reported as they represent economic as opposed to clinical results. We disagree: publishing quality of life data in a separate academic paper is in no sense a recognised universal convention, and we therefore think that readers should have been told that an extra three secondary outcomes were pre-specified and that there was a plan to report these elsewhere.

The authors lastly suggest that, where studies are funded by NIHR, readers should already know that further information on changes to the pre-specified outcomes could be gleaned by reading various other online NIHR documents associated with the trial. We view that suggestion as problematic. By the authors’ own tacit admission these documents were not available when their BMJ paper was published, and when our assessment was conducted. Furthermore, NIHR-funded trials represent only a tiny fraction of medical research, and so very few readers will know that additional documents may be available, where outcome switching may be declared or discussed, for trials with this specific funding source. CONSORT guidance states clearly that the information needed to detect such changes should be presented clearly in the trial report. From our experience it can take up to 5 hours per trial to check for outcome switching, even using only the protocol, registry entry, and journal publication. Relying on readers to check, even in these documents alone, is therefore impractically onerous. Expecting all readers to know that they should also be reviewing an additional set of documents - which may or may not exist, for a subset of trials depending on funder, with an unspecified time delay - represents an even more impractical method to ensure transparent outcome reporting, especially when the fact that these documents may contain additional information on outcome switching is not even mentioned in the primary academic publication of the trial’s results.

The deviation in sample size mentioned is beyond the aims and protocol of COMPare, and is not mentioned in our assessment or letter. The authors mention that we do not praise other aspects of their trial: again, these are outside the remit of COMPare, which is solely to identify and then flag incomplete outcome reporting to journal editors and the readers of trial reports, in order to drive improvement on this prevalent problem. It may be useful to note that this specific trial scores very much more positively for outcome reporting than most other trials we have reviewed: however this reflects the chaotic state of information management in the medical literature more broadly.

We thank the authors of REEACT for their open discussion of our analysis.

Yours faithfully,

Henry Drysdale, Ben Goldacre, and Carl Heneghan on behalf of the COMPare team.'

                    trial registry entries, and compared these against those
                    published in the report. This is not necessarily a problem:
                    trial registers were set up explicitly for the purpose of
                    preventing selective reporting of outcomes, with support
                    from august bodies such as ICMJE, WHO, and legislation

                    >However, there is an extra feature, around an important
                    issue: who should take responsibility for misreported
                    outcomes in clinical trials? We think journals have a clear
                    set of roles and responsibilities here, not least because so
                    many are listed as endorsing the CONSORT guidelines, which
                    explicitly state that all prespecified outcomes should be
                    reported. The Lancet have somewhat absented themselves from
                    this discussion. Our published correction letters have, in
                    most cases, been accompanied by letters from other
                    researchers raising methodological criticisms of the trial
                    in question. In all cases, our published letters have been
                    accompanied by an author’s reply. Where this reply has
                    reiterated significant misrepresentations or
                    misunderstandings around pre-specification of outcomes, we
                    have written a follow-up letter to the journal to point
                    these out. However, each of these subsequent letters has
                    been rejected by the Lancet editors; and our efforts to get
                    the Lancet editors themselves to give a view, on misreported
                    outcomes in their journal, have not yet had a reply.

                    outcome switching. This is a surprising and concerning
                    choice by Annals editors: to use inaccessible documents is
                    itself concerning. Moreover, trial registers were
                    specifically set up over a decade ago to address this need,
                    and to address selective outcome reporting, with legislation
                    from national governments alongside near universal support
                    and endorsement from the medical and academic community,
                    regulators, academic journals, and organisations such as the
                    International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and the
                    World Health Organisation. To undermine and abandon this
                    resource, as Annals editors seem to have done, seems a
                    remarkable choice, and one that warrants extensive public
                    discussion and debate.</span

                    giving an overall summary figure for how often this problem
                    occurs. At COMPare we decided to go one step further: we
                    have written a letter for publication on every trial that
                    misreported its outcomes. Our reasons for doing this were
                    twofold. Firstly, we wanted to test whether the mechanisms
                    of science for correcting the record would function
                    correctly. Secondly, we thought that the responses of the
                    system, or the journals, might help shed light on why this
                    problem has persisted, despite extensive public promises
                    that it had already been addressed. You can see for yourself

                    were published in Annals, and all of these reports contained
                    misreported outcomes, to varying degrees. We pointed out
                    these errors in online comments for publication, on all the
                    relevant trials. We expected that Annals editors would
                    publish our corrections, encourage authors to address their
                    errors, and report the prespecified outcomes as per best

                      analysed every RCT published in the top 5 medical journals
                      to check if they had correctly reported their
                      pre-specified outcomes. Where we found discrepancies

                  COMPare aims to fix the ongoing problem of outcome switching
                  in clinical trials by assessing individual trials for
                  misreported outcomes, openly sharing our results, and then
                  submitting correction letters to the journals concerned. From
                  the outset, the question on our minds was: how will the
                  journals respond? We’ve now had a range of responses, from a
                  range of journals, and one striking feature is the diversity
                  of approaches to these reporting errors being pointed out.
                  Here is an example of best practice, from the BMJ.

                    outcome switching in clinical trials. We wanted to move on
                    from simple studies reporting the prevalence of this issue,
                    and instead we are exploring what happens when you try to
                    correct the record on individual trials. From the outset,
                    the key aspect of this work was: how will journals respond?
                    In advance of our first academic publication on the project,
                    consistent with our open data approach, we are now beginning
                    to share the responses we have had from journals. We think
                    they provide important qualitative information on the
                    reasons why this problem has persisted for so long. They are
                    also highly varied: the BMJ, for example, demonstrated best
