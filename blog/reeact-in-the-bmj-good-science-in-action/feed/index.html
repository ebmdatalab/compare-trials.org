		<description><![CDATA[As a trialist, I think the work you are doing is important, but I also wonder if it generating sensationalistic headlines. I am certainly concerned about investigators switching primary outcomes to suit their hypothesis. That sort of thing must be stamped out.  The issue around non-primary outcomes is tricky. My sense is that there is huge variation between how investigators apply the terms &quot;secondary&quot; and &quot;other&quot; outcomes.  Unfortunately, they are used interchangeably, and sometimes there are so many secondary outcomes listed, they could not possibly all be listed in print, although they can now be included in online appendices.  I think that many investigators would be unclear about how publication of secondary outcomes in an appendix would impact on ability to publish these as an independent paper. It is problematic when outcomes are switched or hidden to change the interpretation of results but I, perhaps naively, wonder whether this is less often the case than attempts to get the primary message into print with the limited space available.  There is yet another problem. A colleague of mine told me of the urgency with which his group published the results of a trial in NEJM.  All of the primary analyses were carried out but certainly there wasn&#039;t the extent of exploration that might be deemed problematic by your project.  The investigators were not trying to misrepresent their results in any way.  There are all sorts of reasons there is pressure to get things published rapidly.  Even with the intention of publishing secondary results in secondary papers, it is inevitably more difficult to get these published in a secondary paper, especially if the secondary results are less &quot;exciting&quot; than the primary.  And, of course, after a few rejections of a secondary paper, investigators often move onto something else, not out of an agenda to hide anything that would change results, but just because of priorities, What I do agree is that there could be online repositories where tables of all the stated outcomes of a trial could be presented, if not published in a journal.]]></description>
