You write, &quot;CONSORT includes a commitment that all pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes should be reported; and that, where new outcomes are reported, it should be made clear that these were added at a later date, with an explanation of when and for what reason.&quot;

Your wording perhaps implies a stronger safeguard than CONSORT (Section 6b) actually recommends. CONSORT (disappointingly) requires pre-specified outcomes to be reported BUT if new outcomes are reported, there should be an explanation given (and the original analyses need not be reported).

This allows authors to ditch their pre-specified analyses and replace them with others, as long as they give a reason for it - no matter how ridiculous.

The PACE trial of rehabilitative therapies for chronic fatigue syndrome is the classic examplar of this. All the main outcome analyses and &quot;recovery&quot; analyses that were specified in the protocol were abandoned. The reasons given were weak (&quot;to allow more sensitive analysis&quot;) or wrong (one new threshold was created by applying a mean and SD to clearly non-normal population data of the wrong age range).

The new analyses led to a threshold for clinical effectiveness and recovery for physical function of 60/100 on the SF-36 scale that was so low that it was below the level of disability required for trial entry (65/100) and similar to the mean score for patients with Class II congestive heart failure.

Nevertheless, key analyses based on this ludicrous threshold (and another like it, for fatigue) are the basis for claims that the therapies were successful. They were published without question in The Lancet and Psychological Medicine - presumably because the authors had offered &quot;an explanation&quot;.

Over 12,000 patients have signed a petition demanding retraction of these analyses and have been ignored. Both the patients and 42 scientists, in an open letter have requested per-protocol reanalysis. 27 ME/CFS organisations representing tens of thousands of patients have written to the study authors asking them to release the data for independent reanalysis, while the authors appeal a decision by the Information Commissioner. The study authors have persistently refused to do the original analyses themselves.

This is the situation that we&#039;re now in, because CONSORT is weak on this issue. Per-protocol analyses should be reported, no matter what. Additional analyses should be allowed, with reasons given.

A strengthened CONSORT should be law, not guidelines, with stiff legal penalties for breaches. It&#039;s unacceptable that patients risk their health in trials and get treated the way that patients have been treated in PACE.]]></description>
