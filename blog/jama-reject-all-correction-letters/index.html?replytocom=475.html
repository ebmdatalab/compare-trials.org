                      analysed every RCT published in the top 5 medical journals
                      to check if they had correctly reported their
                      pre-specified outcomes. Where we found discrepancies
                      between the outcomes that were pre-specified and those
                      reported, we wrote a letter to that journal to correct the
                      record. Our intention was to test whether the structures
                      of science are working as they should, and specifically to
                      see whether academic journals are transparent and
                      self-correcting in the face of legitimate concerns being
                      raised about misreporting of trial results. The responses

                        that it is important for researchers to pre-specify
                        primary and secondary outcomes before conducting a trial
                        and to report outcomes accurately in their publications.
                        In fact, we carefully monitor this during editorial

                        ordinarily is the document submitted to the IRB and

                        protocol, especially if clearly documented, justified,
                        and approved revisions to the protocol have occurred.
                        Inaccuracies in the trial registration documents are
                        more of an issue for the individuals overseeing the

                          We try, wherever possible, to use outcomes as
                          pre-specified in the protocol. However, it is often
                          the case that the protocol version supplied is dated
                          post trial commencement, without a detailed history of
                          changes that allow us to check how the endpoints have
                          been altered, or justification for those changes. For
                          example, in the article by Wechsler et al., one of the
                          changes in the version history provides a change to
                          version 3 dated March 8, 2013 (two years after trial
                          commencement): “Change in analytic model for secondary
                          endpoints” with the reason given as: “Incorporating Dr
                          Israel’s comments.” It is for these reasons that we
                          have used the registry entry in this case, as that
                          provides an exact change log, allowing us to see the
                          endpoints as they were at trial commencement.
                          Furthermore, CONSORT requires that deviations from the
                          initially pre-specified outcomes are declared and
                          discussed in the paper reporting the trial’s results
                          (not multiple versions of earlier lengthy protocols).
                          We feel this is reasonable, because otherwise all
                          readers would have to search through large numbers of
                          additional documents to identify any changes, which in
                          our now considerable experience are unlikely to be
                          adequately declared and explained in any case.</span

                          use the registry entry to identify pre-specified
                          outcomes where there is no publicly accessible
                          protocol dating from before trial commencement. We are
                          extremely concerned by your comment that “the trial
                          registration may not always accurately reflect the
                          protocol”, and that inaccuracies “are more of an issue
                          for the individuals overseeing the trial registries”.
                          Trial registers were specifically set up to address
                          the issue of selective non-publication of whole trials
                          and individual outcomes, strongly endorsed by ICMJE,
                          and often the only place where pre-specified outcomes
                          from before trial commencement can be found. We feel
                          the onus is on trialists and journal editors to ensure
                          that all pre-specified outcomes are reported
                          correctly, and that where there are discrepancies or
                          inaccuracies, these are correctly highlighted in the
                          report. Where outcomes are pre-specified so unclearly
                          that correct reporting cannot be ascertained, this
                          could also be pointed out in a trial report.</span

                          that space restrictions may not allow all secondary or
                          exploratory outcomes to be reported in one document,
                          but would hope that these omissions are at least
                          mentioned, with a reason given, as (again) stated by
                          CONSORT, endorsed by JAMA. Declaring any switched or
                          unreported outcomes allows the reader to place the
                          reported outcomes in their appropriate statistical and
                          interpretative context. Furthermore, many reports we
                          have analysed throughout our study have added several
                          novel non-pre-specified outcomes, in addition to
                          removing pre-specified outcomes. We therefore feel
                          ‘space restrictions’ is not a reasonable justification
                          for undeclared non-reporting of pre-specified
                          outcomes.</span

                        standards on reporting clinical trials. However we are
                        also aware that studies have repeatedly been published
                        demonstrating a very high prevalence of discrepancies
                        between pre-specified and reported outcomes [1,2],
                        despite public statements by journals that they police
                        this issue. Our findings are consistent with these
                        previous studies, but , rather than simply publishing an
                        anonymised prevalence figure on outcome switching
                        overall, we have begun writing on every individual
                        trial. This is for two reasons: firstly, to correct the
                        record on individual trials in individual journals; and
                        secondly to create a public discussion on best practice
                        and policies around misreported outcomes, with real
                        worked examples where outcome switching has
                        occurred.</span

                    >This correspondence speaks for itself. As we have shown in
                    detail, trial reports published in JAMA repeatedly misreport
                    their pre-specified outcomes, and JAMA have so far acted to
                    deprive readers of this important information. There are two
                    additional issues to raise, that are not covered in the
                    above reply.

                      >Firstly, JAMA state that they monitor pre-specification
                      and reporting of outcomes, stating: “We agree that it is
                      important for researchers to pre-specify primary and
                      secondary outcomes before conducting a trial and to report
                      outcomes accurately in their publications. In fact, we
                      carefully monitor this during editorial review.” However,
                      as our 13 analyses of their publications have shown,
                      trials published in JAMA routinely misreport their
                      pre-specified outcomes. If you have any doubts, we

                      of how JAMA misreported a clinical trial. These repeated
                      failures strongly suggest that their internal mechanisms,
                      whatever they may be, have failed, and that they warrant
                      review. It would be useful if JAMA could set out what
                      their internal checking processes consist of, so that
                      others can learn from their experiences.</span

                      although it is hard to act on, paradoxically, because of
                      restrictions imposed by JAMA and other journals
                      themselves. JAMA say: “In addition, some of the
                      information in your letters is vague, containing only
                      numbers and not specific outcomes, making it difficult to
                      understand the specific issues or reply to them.” We would
                      be keen to include a list of all misreported outcomes in
                      all letters. Sadly we are unable to do so, because of
                      limits imposed by journals on the word length of letters
                      submitted in response to research they have published. For
                      JAMA, this limit is </span

                      flaws, and both prevent all misreported outcomes being
                      enumerated in a letter, because the scale of misreporting
                      in these journals is so extensive that the unreported and
                      non-prespecified outcomes simply cannot be listed within
                      their own word limits.

                    <div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
                      <p>Thank you for reporting on this important topic.</p>
                      <p>
                        You write, &#8220;CONSORT includes a commitment that all
                        pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes should be
                        reported; and that, where new outcomes are reported, it
                        should be made clear that these were added at a later
                        date, with an explanation of when and for what
                        reason.&#8221;
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Your wording perhaps implies a stronger safeguard than
                        CONSORT (Section 6b) actually recommends. CONSORT
                        (disappointingly) requires pre-specified outcomes to be
                        reported BUT if new outcomes are reported, there should
                        be an explanation given (and the original analyses need
                        not be reported).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This allows authors to ditch their pre-specified
                        analyses and replace them with others, as long as they
                        give a reason for it &#8211; no matter how ridiculous.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The PACE trial of rehabilitative therapies for chronic
                        fatigue syndrome is the classic examplar of this. All
                        the main outcome analyses and &#8220;recovery&#8221;
                        analyses that were specified in the protocol were
                        abandoned. The reasons given were weak (&#8220;to allow
                        more sensitive analysis&#8221;) or wrong (one new
                        threshold was created by applying a mean and SD to
                        clearly non-normal population data of the wrong age
                        range).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The new analyses led to a threshold for clinical
                        effectiveness and recovery for physical function of
                        60/100 on the SF-36 scale that was so low that it was
                        below the level of disability required for trial entry
                        (65/100) and similar to the mean score for patients with
                        Class II congestive heart failure.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Nevertheless, key analyses based on this ludicrous
                        threshold (and another like it, for fatigue) are the
                        basis for claims that the therapies were successful.
                        They were published without question in The Lancet and
                        Psychological Medicine &#8211; presumably because the
                        authors had offered &#8220;an explanation&#8221;.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Over 12,000 patients have signed a petition demanding
                        retraction of these analyses and have been ignored. Both
                        the patients and 42 scientists, in an open letter have
                        requested per-protocol reanalysis. 27 ME/CFS
                        organisations representing tens of thousands of patients
                        have written to the study authors asking them to release
                        the data for independent reanalysis, while the authors
                        appeal a decision by the Information Commissioner. The
                        study authors have persistently refused to do the
                        original analyses themselves.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This is the situation that we&#8217;re now in, because
                        CONSORT is weak on this issue. Per-protocol analyses
                        should be reported, no matter what. Additional analyses
                        should be allowed, with reasons given.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        A strengthened CONSORT should be law, not guidelines,
                        with stiff legal penalties for breaches. It&#8217;s
                        unacceptable that patients risk their health in trials
                        and get treated the way that patients have been treated
                        in PACE.
                      </p>
