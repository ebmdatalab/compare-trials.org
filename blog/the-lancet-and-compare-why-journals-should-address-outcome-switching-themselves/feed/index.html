		<description><![CDATA[This highlights a number of important issues about clinical trial reporting.  While &quot;outcome switching&quot; is probably not the major issue that leads to a distortion of the clinical evidence base (a misunderstanding of p values, as discussed here: http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidgrainger/2015/01/29/why-too-many-clinical-trials-fail-and-a-simple-solution-that-could-increase-returns-on-pharma-rd/#4d8d3c275f67 most likely has that honour), it is nevertheless entirely appropriate that COMPare-trials.org holds journals (and by extension principal investigators to account on this issue).

The inadequate response from a number of leading journals - most notably JAMA and NEJM, but also Lancet, highlights the central issue: clinical trials rely on patient (or volunteer) participation, and the moral payback for their participation is open reporting of the resultant data.  Is it, then, appropriate at all for commercial for-profit publishers to police that activity?

The observations of COMPare-trials.org suggests that the self-regulation through peer-review and the oversight from commercial publishers is manifestly failing.  This is unsurprising: both researchers and publishers have competing priorities, which are misaligned with the interests of the community from whom patients and volunteers are drawn.  This conflict leads to the current situation, where the participants give lip-service to open reporting, by notionally adopting guidelines such as CONSORT, but then fail to properly implement them.  An unbiased reader might observe that the editors see their role as protecting the trial authors from enquiry by organisations such as yours, rather than holding them to the highest standards the community of participants has a right to expect.

While your approach is commendable, the only long term solution is to move away from a situation where peer-review editorial boards and commercial publishers are responsible for the oversight.  We should transfer oversight of reporting to the Research Ethics Committees who approved the trial designs in the first place, with a clear understanding that failure to comply with the reporting standards will (a) be made public and (b) disbar the investigators from further clinical research activities.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Should not as a matter of policy incompletely reported trials be excluded from Evidence Based Medicine guidelines? If journals fail their fiduciary duty to vet reports for sources of bias, they mislead their readers and become part of the problem. The disclosure of switched outcomes reporting in clinical trials is much needed. Hopefully, Compare will periodically publish a list of the clinical trials and the journals involved, together with its correspondence with the offending authors and journal editors. In publishing such a list, besides being alerted to the sources of biased information, readers will want to learn the nature and extent of the possible bias contained in the published reports.]]></description>
