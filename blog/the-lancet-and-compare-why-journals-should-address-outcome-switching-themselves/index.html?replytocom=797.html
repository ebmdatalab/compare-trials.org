                    >However, there is an extra feature, around an important
                    issue: who should take responsibility for misreported
                    outcomes in clinical trials? We think journals have a clear
                    set of roles and responsibilities here, not least because so
                    many are listed as endorsing the CONSORT guidelines, which
                    explicitly state that all prespecified outcomes should be
                    reported. The Lancet have somewhat absented themselves from
                    this discussion. Our published correction letters have, in
                    most cases, been accompanied by letters from other
                    researchers raising methodological criticisms of the trial
                    in question. In all cases, our published letters have been
                    accompanied by an author’s reply. Where this reply has
                    reiterated significant misrepresentations or
                    misunderstandings around pre-specification of outcomes, we
                    have written a follow-up letter to the journal to point
                    these out. However, each of these subsequent letters has
                    been rejected by the Lancet editors; and our efforts to get
                    the Lancet editors themselves to give a view, on misreported
                    outcomes in their journal, have not yet had a reply. </span

                      >We view this cessation of public discussion as
                      problematic for two key reasons. Firstly, these author
                      replies often portray important misunderstandings, on the
                      part of trialists, about selective reporting and the
                      mechanisms to prevent it. Open discussion on these issues
                      would likely help to reduce the prevalence of such
                      misreporting, which is a common source of bias in clinical
                      trials. But there is a second issue, perhaps even more
                      important, around who should take responsibility and
                      police outcome switching. In their actions, the Lancet
                      seem to suggest that this is a matter for trialists. We
                      think journals should take responsibility themselves, to
                      ensure that outcomes are correctly reported in the trials
                      they publish. This is especially so in the case of the
                      Lancet, because they are prominent public supporters of
                      initiatives to improve reporting standards, such as the </span

                    >At present, many of those reading trial reports in academic
                    journals will reasonably assume that outcome switching has
                    been checked for and excluded by the large professional
                    editorial teams on leading journals. If this is known not to
                    be done, then one solution is disclosure: journals could
                    more prominently warn their readers to be wary of outcome
                    switching, and publicly state that they do not address such
                    misreporting at an editorial level. A better option would be
                    to address the issue, and ensure all outcomes are reported.
                    This approach is neither expensive nor onerous. Trials are
                    conducted, at enormous financial cost, only because they are
                    less vulnerable to bias and confounding than other forms of
                    research. Reporting outcomes completely, as required by
                    CONSORT, is a zero-cost intervention to reduce bias in
                    clinical trials, and it therefore makes little sense to
                    permit outcome switching to persist.

                    >The Lancet is one of the world’s leading medical journals:
                    it sets the tone for the community, and plays an extremely
                    influential role in generating the evidence base on which
                    clinical decisions are made. It is good that some of our
                    correction letters have been published, and discussion with
                    the authors encouraged. However, by rejecting rebuttals on
                    important misunderstandings or erroneous comments around
                    outcome switching, and by declining to express a view on
                    shortcomings against the high standards they have set
                    themselves, we feel the Lancet is missing an opportunity to
                    host an important and informative debate on this issue, to
                    the benefit of all concerned.</span

                        Should not as a matter of policy incompletely reported
                        trials be excluded from Evidence Based Medicine
                        guidelines? If journals fail their fiduciary duty to vet
                        reports for sources of bias, they mislead their readers
                        and become part of the problem. The disclosure of
                        switched outcomes reporting in clinical trials is much
                        needed. Hopefully, Compare will periodically publish a
                        list of the clinical trials and the journals involved,
                        together with its correspondence with the offending
                        authors and journal editors. In publishing such a list,
                        besides being alerted to the sources of biased
                        information, readers will want to learn the nature and
                        extent of the possible bias contained in the published
                        reports.

                        This highlights a number of important issues about
                        clinical trial reporting. While &#8220;outcome
                        switching&#8221; is probably not the major issue that
                        leads to a distortion of the clinical evidence base (a
                        misunderstanding of p values, as discussed here:

                        most likely has that honour), it is nevertheless
                        entirely appropriate that COMPare-trials.org holds
                        journals (and by extension principal investigators to
                        account on this issue).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The inadequate response from a number of leading
                        journals &#8211; most notably JAMA and NEJM, but also
                        Lancet, highlights the central issue: clinical trials
                        rely on patient (or volunteer) participation, and the
                        moral payback for their participation is open reporting
                        of the resultant data. Is it, then, appropriate at all
                        for commercial for-profit publishers to police that
                        activity?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The observations of COMPare-trials.org suggests that the
                        self-regulation through peer-review and the oversight
                        from commercial publishers is manifestly failing. This
                        is unsurprising: both researchers and publishers have
                        competing priorities, which are misaligned with the
                        interests of the community from whom patients and
                        volunteers are drawn. This conflict leads to the current
                        situation, where the participants give lip-service to
                        open reporting, by notionally adopting guidelines such
                        as CONSORT, but then fail to properly implement them. An
                        unbiased reader might observe that the editors see their
                        role as protecting the trial authors from enquiry by
                        organisations such as yours, rather than holding them to
                        the highest standards the community of participants has
                        a right to expect.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        While your approach is commendable, the only long term
                        solution is to move away from a situation where
                        peer-review editorial boards and commercial publishers
                        are responsible for the oversight. We should transfer
                        oversight of reporting to the Research Ethics Committees
                        who approved the trial designs in the first place, with
                        a clear understanding that failure to comply with the
                        reporting standards will (a) be made public and (b)
                        disbar the investigators from further clinical research
                        activities.
