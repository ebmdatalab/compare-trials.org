                    giving an overall summary figure for how often this problem
                    occurs. At COMPare we decided to go one step further: we
                    have written a letter for publication on every trial that
                    misreported its outcomes. Our reasons for doing this were
                    twofold. Firstly, we wanted to test whether the mechanisms
                    of science for correcting the record would function
                    correctly. Secondly, we thought that the responses of the
                    system, or the journals, might help shed light on why this
                    problem has persisted, despite extensive public promises
                    that it had already been addressed. You can see for yourself

                    were published in Annals, and all of these reports contained

                        In an email to BG some weeks ago I suggested writing
                        individually to all AoIM editors to ask whether they
                        approve of the journal&#8217;s actions in their name. BG
                        said it was an interesting idea. It seems even more
                        appropriate now.
