		<description><![CDATA[The health economist Uwe Reinhart has allegedly observed that health care prices are “chaos behind a veil of silence.” In the place that I could find he states, “The high variance of health care prices in the United States can be explained in good part by the opacity of these prices. Both government and the private sector have done their best to maintain that opacity.” http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/u-s-health-care-prices-are-the-elephant-in-the-room/?_r=0.

And so it is with medical journals that fail to disclose sufficient information by which readers can assess the reliability and validity of published reports. Instead, readers are expected to have faith in the reputational authority of the medical journal. Religion urges embrace of faith. Empirical science eschews faith in favor of demonstrated evidence. The guiding principle of inquiry is skepticism rather than reliance on authority.

Ben Goldacre’s “How did NEJM respond when we tried to correct 20 misreported trials?” provides a window into the workings of the NEJM in this regard.  It seems that almost every week a new study surfaces about the unreliability of medical journal reports and the harm done to patients as a result. Just one example is Mark Wilson’s recent Indian Journal of Medical Ethics report documenting how the NEJM failure to publish what it knew about the dangers of Vioxx was responsible for many preventable Vioxx-related illnesses and deaths. http://ijme.in/index.php/ijme/article/view/2407/4974

Is there a solution in sight? In his comment to the aforementioned Goldacre report, Boris says, “If publishing bad stuff creates bad publicity, people will stop in the end.” Apparently, the crescendo of bad publicity is not yet enough to modify the bad behavior of medical journal publishers.  It will probably take a significant loss of subscription income to bring about change for the better.

Ironically, medical journals are held to a lesser standard than tour agencies under the U.S. common law duty to discover and warn of anticipated dangers. See: Dickerson, T.A. (1981). Travel Law. New York, NY: Law Journal Seminars-Press, ©1981- Retrieved from http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/9jd/TacCert_pdfs/Dickerson_Docs/Duty_To_Warn_Of_Danger_The_Chinese_Tick_Case4.pdf. Arguably, the subscriber to a medical journal seeks knowledge of vetted medical science much like a tourist taking a tour to discover and learn about new places. Doesn’t the medical journal subscriber deserve fair warning about the known dangers of relying on published reports of new scientific findings?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is alarming that most of the trials were found to have switched outcomes and what s even more disturbing is the stance of the journal editors who do not feel responsible for alerting the readers and getting the records corrected. Considering the fact that the results are used by doctors and policy makers, journals should insist on accurate reporting of outcomes in the papers they publish. Would it not be in the best interest of the journals as well if the papers they publish meet ethical standards?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Journals, especially those at the top of the tree, aren&#039;t really configured to admit error or doubt, hence the minuscule possibilities for correspondence . If they conceded this point, they would have to generate many corrections, which would look really bad. To avoid admitting error multiple times, any excuse will do (and that is what you are getting).

However, the aims of this excellent campaign are such plain good sense that it is bound to be effective in the longer term. Keep up the good work! If publishing bad stuff creates bad publicity, people will stop in the end. In that respect, posting material on PubMed Commons (whence it will be automatically mirrored on PubPeer and its plugins) is likely to be quite effective. In particular, such comments will stick to the paper and journal forever rather than fade with the news cycle. One would just need a link to each case. A relevant example is the campaign led by Amanda Capes-Davis on studies using incorrectly identified cancer cell lines.

Endorsing CONSORT guidelines but not desiring to apply them is quite fancy footwork. They clearly hire a better class of politician at the NEJM.]]></description>
