		<description><![CDATA[The health economist Uwe Reinhart has allegedly observed that health care prices are “chaos behind a veil of silence.” In the place that I could find he states, “The high variance of health care prices in the United States can be explained in good part by the opacity of these prices. Both government and the private sector have done their best to maintain that opacity.” http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/u-s-health-care-prices-are-the-elephant-in-the-room/?_r=0.

And so it is with medical journals that fail to disclose sufficient information by which readers can assess the reliability and validity of published reports. Instead, readers are expected to have faith in the reputational authority of the medical journal. Religion urges embrace of faith. Empirical science eschews faith in favor of demonstrated evidence. The guiding principle of inquiry is skepticism rather than reliance on authority.

Ben Goldacre’s “How did NEJM respond when we tried to correct 20 misreported trials?” provides a window into the workings of the NEJM in this regard.  It seems that almost every week a new study surfaces about the unreliability of medical journal reports and the harm done to patients as a result. Just one example is Mark Wilson’s recent Indian Journal of Medical Ethics report documenting how the NEJM failure to publish what it knew about the dangers of Vioxx was responsible for many preventable Vioxx-related illnesses and deaths. http://ijme.in/index.php/ijme/article/view/2407/4974

Is there a solution in sight? In his comment to the aforementioned Goldacre report, Boris says, “If publishing bad stuff creates bad publicity, people will stop in the end.” Apparently, the crescendo of bad publicity is not yet enough to modify the bad behavior of medical journal publishers.  It will probably take a significant loss of subscription income to bring about change for the better.

Ironically, medical journals are held to a lesser standard than tour agencies under the U.S. common law duty to discover and warn of anticipated dangers. See: Dickerson, T.A. (1981). Travel Law. New York, NY: Law Journal Seminars-Press, ©1981- Retrieved from http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/9jd/TacCert_pdfs/Dickerson_Docs/Duty_To_Warn_Of_Danger_The_Chinese_Tick_Case4.pdf. Arguably, the subscriber to a medical journal seeks knowledge of vetted medical science much like a tourist taking a tour to discover and learn about new places. Doesn’t the medical journal subscriber deserve fair warning about the known dangers of relying on published reports of new scientific findings?]]></description>

		<title>Comment on Resistance and misunderstanding from the journal editors on outcome switching &#8211; What does the FDA say? by John H Noble Jr</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Dr. Bernard Carroll, MBBS, PhD, FRCPsych. Professor and Chairman Emeritus, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, is soliciting signatures for a petition to the U.S. Congress addressing at least one part of the FDA-NIH interface problem that you identify. He writes:

Colleagues,
 
I am distributing a petition to the US Congress that I have helped to write over the summer. It is called “Truth in Research Labeling.” Here is the link for you to read it: http://tinyurl.com/hja4ccy. Feel free to sign it after reading the Executive Summary if you are too busy to read the whole thing. Thanks to the Lown Institute in Boston for sponsoring the on-line presence of this petition.
 
This petition aims to clean up the reporting of clinical trials by getting the FDA on the same page as NIH (ClinicalTrials.gov). The graphic below says it well – a picture is worth a thousand words. Right now, FDA and NIH don’t talk to each other, so a lot of dubious claims – or worse – go unregulated into the medical journals.
 
https://assets.change.org/photos/3/tg/xl/CBtgxliSeblIOgV-800x450-noPad.jpg?1475085058
 
          This petition is unlike most petitions to the Congress. It goes beyond simply making claims. It cites as evidence for these claims the best available scholarship. The petition also provides suggested language for amending Section 801 of the Public Health Service Act to bring about the desired change.
 
          The issues we address affect the integrity of biomedical science and, ultimately, the quality of the medical care that we all receive. If the Congress responds to the petition by adopting the changes of law that we propose, all of us will benefit . . . most of all our patients.

If you agree with the thrust of the petition, please sign on to lend your support . . . and pass it around through your networks. We are hoping that Senator Elizabeth Warren will at some point embrace and sponsor this initiative as part of her consumer protections advocacy agenda. Those of you who are based outside the USA may still sign it – and perhaps it can serve as a template for similar efforts in your own countries.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This highlights a number of important issues about clinical trial reporting.  While &quot;outcome switching&quot; is probably not the major issue that leads to a distortion of the clinical evidence base (a misunderstanding of p values, as discussed here: http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidgrainger/2015/01/29/why-too-many-clinical-trials-fail-and-a-simple-solution-that-could-increase-returns-on-pharma-rd/#4d8d3c275f67 most likely has that honour), it is nevertheless entirely appropriate that COMPare-trials.org holds journals (and by extension principal investigators to account on this issue).

The inadequate response from a number of leading journals - most notably JAMA and NEJM, but also Lancet, highlights the central issue: clinical trials rely on patient (or volunteer) participation, and the moral payback for their participation is open reporting of the resultant data.  Is it, then, appropriate at all for commercial for-profit publishers to police that activity?

The observations of COMPare-trials.org suggests that the self-regulation through peer-review and the oversight from commercial publishers is manifestly failing.  This is unsurprising: both researchers and publishers have competing priorities, which are misaligned with the interests of the community from whom patients and volunteers are drawn.  This conflict leads to the current situation, where the participants give lip-service to open reporting, by notionally adopting guidelines such as CONSORT, but then fail to properly implement them.  An unbiased reader might observe that the editors see their role as protecting the trial authors from enquiry by organisations such as yours, rather than holding them to the highest standards the community of participants has a right to expect.

While your approach is commendable, the only long term solution is to move away from a situation where peer-review editorial boards and commercial publishers are responsible for the oversight.  We should transfer oversight of reporting to the Research Ethics Committees who approved the trial designs in the first place, with a clear understanding that failure to comply with the reporting standards will (a) be made public and (b) disbar the investigators from further clinical research activities.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Should not as a matter of policy incompletely reported trials be excluded from Evidence Based Medicine guidelines? If journals fail their fiduciary duty to vet reports for sources of bias, they mislead their readers and become part of the problem. The disclosure of switched outcomes reporting in clinical trials is much needed. Hopefully, Compare will periodically publish a list of the clinical trials and the journals involved, together with its correspondence with the offending authors and journal editors.

		<description><![CDATA[As a trialist, I think the work you are doing is important, but I also wonder if it generating sensationalistic headlines. I am certainly concerned about investigators switching primary outcomes to suit their hypothesis. That sort of thing must be stamped out.  The issue around non-primary outcomes is tricky. My sense is that there is huge variation between how investigators apply the terms &quot;secondary&quot; and &quot;other&quot; outcomes.  Unfortunately, they are used interchangeably, and sometimes there are so many secondary outcomes listed, they could not possibly all be listed in print, although they can now be included in online appendices.  I think that many investigators would be unclear about how publication of secondary outcomes in an appendix would impact on ability to publish these as an independent paper. It is problematic when outcomes are switched or hidden to change the interpretation of results but I, perhaps naively, wonder whether this is less often the case than attempts to get the primary message into print with the limited space available.  There is yet another problem. A colleague of mine told me of the urgency with which his group published the results of a trial in NEJM.  All of the primary analyses were carried out but certainly there wasn&#039;t the extent of exploration that might be deemed problematic by your project.  The investigators were not trying to misrepresent their results in any way.  There are all sorts of reasons there is pressure to get things published rapidly.  Even with the intention of publishing secondary results in secondary papers, it is inevitably more difficult to get these published in a secondary paper, especially if the secondary results are less &quot;exciting&quot; than the primary.  And, of course, after a few rejections of a secondary paper, investigators often move onto something else, not out of an agenda to hide anything that would change results, but just because of priorities, What I do agree is that there could be online repositories where tables of all the stated outcomes of a trial could be presented, if not published in a journal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for reporting on this important topic.

You write, &quot;CONSORT includes a commitment that all pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes should be reported; and that, where new outcomes are reported, it should be made clear that these were added at a later date, with an explanation of when and for what reason.&quot;

Your wording perhaps implies a stronger safeguard than CONSORT (Section 6b) actually recommends. CONSORT (disappointingly) requires pre-specified outcomes to be reported BUT if new outcomes are reported, there should be an explanation given (and the original analyses need not be reported).

This allows authors to ditch their pre-specified analyses and replace them with others, as long as they give a reason for it - no matter how ridiculous.

The PACE trial of rehabilitative therapies for chronic fatigue syndrome is the classic examplar of this. All the main outcome analyses and &quot;recovery&quot; analyses that were specified in the protocol were abandoned. The reasons given were weak (&quot;to allow more sensitive analysis&quot;) or wrong (one new threshold was created by applying a mean and SD to clearly non-normal population data of the wrong age range).

The new analyses led to a threshold for clinical effectiveness and recovery for physical function of 60/100 on the SF-36 scale that was so low that it was below the level of disability required for trial entry (65/100) and similar to the mean score for patients with Class II congestive heart failure.

Nevertheless, key analyses based on this ludicrous threshold (and another like it, for fatigue) are the basis for claims that the therapies were successful. They were published without question in The Lancet and Psychological Medicine - presumably because the authors had offered &quot;an explanation&quot;.

Over 12,000 patients have signed a petition demanding retraction of these analyses and have been ignored. Both the patients and 42 scientists, in an open letter have requested per-protocol reanalysis. 27 ME/CFS organisations representing tens of thousands of patients have written to the study authors asking them to release the data for independent reanalysis, while the authors appeal a decision by the Information Commissioner. The study authors have persistently refused to do the original analyses themselves.

This is the situation that we&#039;re now in, because CONSORT is weak on this issue. Per-protocol analyses should be reported, no matter what. Additional analyses should be allowed, with reasons given.

A strengthened CONSORT should be law, not guidelines, with stiff legal penalties for breaches. It&#039;s unacceptable that patients risk their health in trials and get treated the way that patients have been treated in PACE.]]></description>

<p>Your wording perhaps implies a stronger safeguard than CONSORT (Section 6b) actually recommends. CONSORT (disappointingly) requires pre-specified outcomes to be reported BUT if new outcomes are reported, there should be an explanation given (and the original analyses need not be reported).</p>
<p>This allows authors to ditch their pre-specified analyses and replace them with others, as long as they give a reason for it &#8211; no matter how ridiculous.</p>
<p>The PACE trial of rehabilitative therapies for chronic fatigue syndrome is the classic examplar of this. All the main outcome analyses and &#8220;recovery&#8221; analyses that were specified in the protocol were abandoned. The reasons given were weak (&#8220;to allow more sensitive analysis&#8221;) or wrong (one new threshold was created by applying a mean and SD to clearly non-normal population data of the wrong age range).</p>
<p>The new analyses led to a threshold for clinical effectiveness and recovery for physical function of 60/100 on the SF-36 scale that was so low that it was below the level of disability required for trial entry (65/100) and similar to the mean score for patients with Class II congestive heart failure.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, key analyses based on this ludicrous threshold (and another like it, for fatigue) are the basis for claims that the therapies were successful. They were published without question in The Lancet and Psychological Medicine &#8211; presumably because the authors had offered &#8220;an explanation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Over 12,000 patients have signed a petition demanding retraction of these analyses and have been ignored. Both the patients and 42 scientists, in an open letter have requested per-protocol reanalysis. 27 ME/CFS organisations representing tens of thousands of patients have written to the study authors asking them to release the data for independent reanalysis, while the authors appeal a decision by the Information Commissioner. The study authors have persistently refused to do the original analyses themselves.</p>
<p>This is the situation that we&#8217;re now in, because CONSORT is weak on this issue. Per-protocol analyses should be reported, no matter what. Additional analyses should be allowed, with reasons given.</p>
<p>A strengthened CONSORT should be law, not guidelines, with stiff legal penalties for breaches. It&#8217;s unacceptable that patients risk their health in trials and get treated the way that patients have been treated in PACE.</p>
