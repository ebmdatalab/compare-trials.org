Professor and Chairman Emeritus, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, is soliciting signatures for a petition to the U.S. Congress addressing at least one part of the FDA-NIH interface problem that you identify. He writes:

Colleagues,
 
I am distributing a petition to the US Congress that I have helped to write over the summer. It is called “Truth in Research Labeling.” Here is the link for you to read it: http://tinyurl.com/hja4ccy. Feel free to sign it after reading the Executive Summary if you are too busy to read the whole thing. Thanks to the Lown Institute in Boston for sponsoring the on-line presence of this petition.
 
This petition aims to clean up the reporting of clinical trials by getting the FDA on the same page as NIH (ClinicalTrials.gov). The graphic below says it well – a picture is worth a thousand words. Right now, FDA and NIH don’t talk to each other, so a lot of dubious claims – or worse – go unregulated into the medical journals.

          This petition is unlike most petitions to the Congress. It goes beyond simply making claims. It cites as evidence for these claims the best available scholarship. The petition also provides suggested language for amending Section 801 of the Public Health Service Act to bring about the desired change.
 
          The issues we address affect the integrity of biomedical science and, ultimately, the quality of the medical care that we all receive. If the Congress responds to the petition by adopting the changes of law that we propose, all of us will benefit . . . most of all our patients.

If you agree with the thrust of the petition, please sign on to lend your support . . . and pass it around through your networks. We are hoping that Senator Elizabeth Warren will at some point embrace and sponsor this initiative as part of her consumer protections advocacy agenda. Those of you who are based outside the USA may still sign it – and perhaps it can serve as a template for similar efforts in your own countries.]]></description>
